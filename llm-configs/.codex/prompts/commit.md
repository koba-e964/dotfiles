description: Craft a concise git commit message for the current changes and commit.
---
Write a single, concise commit message (<= 72 chars). Prefer imperative mood. If there are multiple changes, pick the highest-impact summary.

If there are unstaged changes, ask the user to stage them. Treat lines like "M  file" in `git status -sb` as already staged changes, not unstaged.

You are responsible to actually commit with the message.
