# Branch Naming

When the user asks to create a branch but does not provide a name:

- Come up with a short, descriptive, kebab-case name based on the change or task.
- Use a prefix like fix-, feat-, or chore- only when it adds clarity.
- Keep it under about 40 characters and avoid vague terms.

Then proceed with the requested git branch and push steps.
